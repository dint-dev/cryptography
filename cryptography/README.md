# Getting started

If you use Flutter, it's recommended (but not necessarily) that you also import our sibling package
[cryptography_flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/cryptography_flutter), which improves performance
by using operating system APIs.

In _pubspec.yaml_:
```yaml
dependencies:
  cryptography: ^2.5.0
  cryptography_flutter: ^2.3.0 # Remove if you don't use Flutter
```

You are ready to go!

# Some things to know
## General guidance on cryptography
Please read [information about Mobile App Cryptography](https://mas.owasp.org/MASTG/General/0x04g-Testing-Cryptography/)
by OWASP. It contains a lot of useful information that helps you build more secure software.

## Common parameters
* [SecretKey](https://pub.dev/documentation/cryptography/latest/cryptography/SecretKey-class.html)
    * Used by ciphers, message authentication codes, and key derivation functions.
* [KeyPair](https://pub.dev/documentation/cryptography/latest/cryptography/KeyPair-class.html)
    * [SimpleKeyPair](https://pub.dev/documentation/cryptography/latest/cryptography/SimpleKeyPair-class.html)
      (Octet sequences such as Ed25519 / X25519 32-byte private keys)
    * [EcKeyPairData](https://pub.dev/documentation/cryptography/latest/cryptography/EcKeyPair-class.html)
      (P-256, P-384, P-521 private keys)
    * [RsaKeyPairData](https://pub.dev/documentation/cryptography/latest/cryptography/RsaKeyPair-class.html)
      (RSA private keys)
* [PublicKey](https://pub.dev/documentation/cryptography/latest/cryptography/PublicKey-class.html)
    * [SimplePublicKey](https://pub.dev/documentation/cryptography/latest/cryptography/SimplePublicKey-class.html)
      (Octet sequences such as Ed25519 / X25519 32-byte public keys)
    * [EcPublicKey](https://pub.dev/documentation/cryptography/latest/cryptography/EcPublicKey-class.html)
      (P-256 / P-384 / P-512 public keys)
    * [RsaPublicKey](https://pub.dev/documentation/cryptography/latest/cryptography/RsaPublicKey-class.html)
      (RSA public keys)

Note that SecretKey and KeyPair instances are opaque and asynchronous by default. They may not be in
the memory and may not be readable at all. If a SecretKey or KeyPair instance is in memory, it's an
instance of one of the following:
* [SecretKeyData](https://pub.dev/documentation/cryptography/latest/cryptography/SecretKeyData-class.html)
* [SimpleKeyPairData](https://pub.dev/documentation/cryptography/latest/cryptography/SimpleKeyPairData-class.html)
* [EcKeyPairData](https://pub.dev/documentation/cryptography/latest/cryptography/EcKeyPairData-class.html)
* [RsaKeyPairData](https://pub.dev/documentation/cryptography/latest/cryptography/RsaKeyPairData-class.html)

For encoding/decoding private/public keys in JWK (JSON Web Key) format, use
[package:jwk](https://pub.dev/packages/jwk).
For encoding/decoding X.509, PKCS12, and other formats, we don't have recommended packages
at the moment.

## Wands (recommended)

For a bit higher API abstraction and sometimes a performance boost, we encourage developers to use
[Wand](https://pub.dev/documentation/cryptography/latest/cryptography/Wand-class.html)
instances which do operations with fixed, "invisible" key (thus "magic wands"). There are currently
three types of wands:
* [CipherWand](https://pub.dev/documentation/cryptography/latest/cryptography/CipherWand-class.html)
* [KeyExchangeWand](https://pub.dev/documentation/cryptography/latest/cryptography/KeyExchangeWand-class.html)
* [SignatureWand](https://pub.dev/documentation/cryptography/latest/cryptography/SignatureWand-class.html)

In the future version 3.x, we plan to transition to wands as the default API for doing operations.

implementations are available:

* [Hmac](https://pub.dev/documentation/cryptography/latest/cryptography/Hmac-class.html)
* [Poly1305](https://pub.dev/documentation/cryptography/latest/cryptography/Poly1305-class.html)

## Cryptographic hash functions

The following [HashAlgorithm](https://pub.dev/documentation/cryptography/latest/cryptography/HashAlgorithm-class.html)
implementations are available:

* [Blake2b](https://pub.dev/documentation/cryptography/latest/cryptography/Blake2b-class.html)
  (BLAKE2B)
* [Blake2s](https://pub.dev/documentation/cryptography/latest/cryptography/Blake2s-class.html)
  (BLAKE2S)

  (SHA2-384)
* [Sha512](https://pub.dev/documentation/cryptography/latest/cryptography/Sha512-class.html)
  (SHA2-512)

The performance is excellent! Our pure Dart implementation of Sha256 is around 2 times faster than
implementation in the older "package:crypto" because of inlining and smarter integer use. If you do
lots of small hashes, the advantage is even bigger because this package allows you re-use the hash
state. Therefore our HMAC-SHA256 is much faster too. In browsers, hashes can be over 100 times
faster because this package automatically uses Web Crypto API.

## Random number generators

We continue to use the old good `Random.secure()` as the default random number in all APIs.

If you do want much faster cryptographically reasonably strong random numbers, this package contains
[SecureRandom.fast](https://pub.dev/documentation/cryptography/latest/cryptography/SecureRandom/fast.html).
It generates random numbers by using 12 round version ChaCha cipher. It can generate up to 0.25 GB
random data per second because it makes expensive operating system call less frequently after the
initial seeding from the operating system. While ChaCha is not designed to be a cryptographic random
number generator, it can be acceptable and a related (Blake2-based) RNG is used by Linux kernel.

If you need a deterministic random number generator for tests, the package contains
[SecureRandom.forTesting](https://pub.dev/documentation/cryptography/latest/cryptography/SecureRandom/SecureRandom.forTesting.html),
which uses the aforementioned ChaCha-based RNG with a fixed seed and no re-seeding.

## Cryptographic factory class

The class [Cryptography](https://pub.dev/documentation/cryptography/latest/cryptography/Cryptography-class.html)
has factory methods that return implementations of cryptographic algorithms. The default
implementation is _BrowserCryptography_ (which works in all platforms, not just browser).

We wrote the following three implementations of `Cryptography`:

* [DartCryptography](https://pub.dev/documentation/cryptography/latest/cryptography.dart/DartCryptography-class.html)
    * Gives you implementations written in pure Dart implementations. They work in all platforms.
    * The algorithms are written and tested by us. They are are licensed under the Apache 2.0 License.
    * See the [class documentation](https://pub.dev/documentation/cryptography/latest/cryptography.dart/DartCryptography-class.html)
      for list algorithms supported by it.
* [BrowserCryptography](https://pub.dev/documentation/cryptography/latest/cryptography/BrowserCryptography-class.html)
    * Uses [Web Cryptography API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API)
      (_crypto.subtle_) whenever possible. Methods return pure Dart implementations when Web
      Cryptography API is not available.
    * See the [class documentation](https://pub.dev/documentation/cryptography/latest/cryptography/BrowserCryptography-class.html)
      for list algorithms supported by it.
* [FlutterCryptography](https://pub.dev/documentation/cryptography_flutter/latest/cryptography_flutter/FlutterCryptography-class.html)
    * Makes cryptographic algorithms up to 100 times faster in Android, iOS, and Mac OS X.
    * Available in the package [cryptography_flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/cryptography_flutter).
    * See the [class documentation](https://pub.dev/documentation/cryptography_flutter/latest/cryptography_flutter/FlutterCryptography-class.html)
      for list algorithms supported by it.

## Deterministic behavior in tests
If you want to have deterministic behavior in tests, you can supply your own random number
generator:

For example:
```dart
import 'package:cryptography/cryptography.dart';

void main() {
  setUp(() {
    Cryptography.instance = Cryptography.instance.withRandom(SecureRandom.forTesting(seed: 42));
  });
  
  test('example', () async {
    final algorithm = AesGcm.with256bits();
    
    // This will will always return the same secret key.
    // because we use a deterministic random number generator.
    final secretKey = await algorithm.newSecretKey();
    
    // ...
  });
}
```

# Examples

## Digital signature

In this example, we use
[Ed25519](https://pub.dev/documentation/cryptography/latest/cryptography/Ed25519-class.html),
a popular signature algorithm:

```dart
import 'package:cryptography/cryptography.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  // The message that we will sign
  final message = <int>[1, 2, 3];

  // Generate a keypair.
  final algorithm = Ed25519();
  final keyPair = await algorithm.newKeyPair();

  // Sign
  final signature = await algorithm.sign(
    message,
    keyPair: keyPair,
  );
  print('Signature: ${signature.bytes}');
  print('Public key: ${signature.publicKey.bytes}');

  // Verify signature
  final isSignatureCorrect = await algorithm.verify(
    message,
    signature: signature,
  );
  print('Correct signature: $isSignatureCorrect');
}
```

## Key agreement

In this example, we
use [X25519](https://pub.dev/documentation/cryptography/latest/cryptography/X25519-class.html),
a popular key agreement algorithm:

```dart
import 'package:cryptography/cryptography.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  final algorithm = X25519();

  // Alice chooses her key pair
  final aliceKeyPair = await algorithm.newKeyPair();

  // Alice knows Bob's public key
  final bobKeyPair = await algorithm.newKeyPair();
  final bobPublicKey = await bobKeyPair.extractPublicKey();

  // Alice calculates the shared secret.
  final sharedSecret = await algorithm.sharedSecretKey(
    keyPair: aliceKeyPair,
    remotePublicKey: bobPublicKey,
  );
  final sharedSecretBytes = await aliceKeyPair.extractBytes();
  print('Shared secret: $sharedSecretBytes');
}
```

## Authenticated encryption
When you encrypt, you need:
* Clear text (bytes you are encrypting)
* [SecretKey](https://pub.dev/documentation/cryptography/latest/cryptography/SecretKey-class.html).
  You can generate a random secret key with
  [cipher.newSecretKey()](https://pub.dev/documentation/cryptography/latest/cryptography/Cipher/newSecretKey.html).
* An optional _nonce_ (also known as "IV", "Initialization Vector", "salt"), which is some
  non-secret byte sequence that MUST be unique each time you encrypt. If you don't provide a
  nonce, a random nonce will be automatically generated for you.

The output of encrypting is [SecretBox](https://pub.dev/documentation/cryptography/latest/cryptography/SecretBox-class.html)
that contains the nonce, the cipher text (the encrypted message), and
[Mac](https://pub.dev/documentation/cryptography/latest/cryptography/Mac-class.html) (a message
authentication code).

When you decrypt, you need the _SecretBox_ and the secret key.

In the following example, we encrypt a message
with [AesCtr](https://pub.dev/documentation/cryptography/latest/cryptography/AesCtr-class.html)
and a [Hmac](https://pub.dev/documentation/cryptography/latest/cryptography/Hmac-class.html) message
authentication code that uses [Sha256](https://pub.dev/documentation/cryptography/latest/cryptography/Sha256-class.html)
hash algorithm:
```dart
import 'dart:convert';
import 'package:cryptography/cryptography.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  // Choose the cipher
  final algorithm = AesCtr.with256bits(macAlgorithm: Hmac.sha256());

  // Generate a random secret key.
  final secretKey = await algorithm.newSecretKey();
  final secretKeyBytes = await secretKey.extractBytes();
  print('Secret key: ${secretKeyBytes}');

  // Encrypt
  final secretBox = await algorithm.encryptString(
    'Hello!',
    secretKey: secretKey,
  );
  print('Nonce: ${secretBox.nonce}'); // Randomly generated nonce
  print('Ciphertext: ${secretBox.cipherText}'); // Encrypted message
  print('MAC: ${secretBox.mac}'); // Message authentication code
  
  // If you are sending the secretBox somewhere, you can concatenate all parts of it:
  final concatenatedBytes = secretBox.concatenation();
  print('All three parts concatenated: $concatenatedBytes');

  // Decrypt
  final clearText = await algorithm.decryptString(
    secretBox,
    secretKey: secretKey,
  );
  print('Cleartext: $clearText'); // Hello!
}
```

## Hashing
In this example, we use [Sha256](https://pub.dev/documentation/cryptography/latest/cryptography/Sha256-class.html):
```dart
import 'package:cryptography/cryptography.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  final sink = Sha256().newHashSink();

  // Add all parts of the authenticated message
  sink.add([1, 2, 3]);
  sink.add([4, 5]);
  sink.add([6]);

  // Calculate hash
  sink.close();
  final hash = await sink.hash();

  print('SHA-512 hash: ${hash.bytes}');
}
```
